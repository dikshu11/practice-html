  <p><b>The present city of Hisar, one of the important cities of North India, is situated 164 kilometers west of Delhi on the National Highway No.10.</b> </p>
 <em>
The city of Hisar was founded by a Muslim ruler, Firozshah Tughlaq in 1354 A.D. 'Hisar' is an Arabic word, which means 'Fort'. The city, which we know today as 'Hisar', was originally called 'Hisar Firoza (also Hisar-e-Firoza) or in other words, the 'Fort of Firoz'. But as the days rolled by, the very word 'Firoza' was dropped from its original name.</em>
